#### School Life and Update:
So I am currently a freshman here at *Mizzou*. I started off as **Business** major while also exploring other fields such as IT and computer science. Hence the reason I am taking this class. I’ve come to the conclusion that I ultimately want to do Health professions- emphasis **sonography**. I would say my first year of college has been eventful and a learning experience. Some of the cons of this year would have to be how poor I am at time management. It’s been a battle managing social life, school life,Personal life and job life. I feel like theres just not enough time in the day to do everything. Second I would say is the unsureness of my major has made me feel pretty *unconfident* and *low*. But I realized it is not a decision you make overnight. I’m glad I took this class because its made me question if I actually coding and is this something I could do long term. *My favorite parts of this year so far has been making new friends, joining clubs such as African student association. I like that there is always something to do on campus its never boring. Its starting to feel more like my second home. I enjoy the student life and the independence of college. I also love our school spirit. Id say my favorite area of school is the student center because its the most liveliest place. Overall I am pretty glad with my decision at mizzou so far! *
